## Getting Started
We, the Lungevity team from CUFE-EECE2026, are proud to present our research on lung cancer detection and prognosis, showcased at the 10th Mathematics Research Day. Utilizing ResNet50, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), we analyzed CT scans to differentiate between normal, malignant, and benign cases.

Our foundation lies in a robust dataset of CT scans sourced from public platforms like Kaggle and Google datasets. This diverse collection encompasses normal, malignant, and benign lung cases, providing the necessary training ground for our AI model.

Our Path Forward:
This project is just the first step in our ongoing battle against lung cancer, we are looking forward to: 
* Perform a detailed comparative analysis of ResNet-50 against competing models (AlexNet and 
Inception-V3) to determine the model with the highest accuracy for cancer detection.
* Instead of employing a two-level binary classification for cancer detection and classification, we 
aim to transition towards a one-level multi-class classification approach, showing its impact on 
the model's accuracy.
* Regarding the IoT solution, the current situations in Palestine makes Egypt try to bring some of 
the Palestinian patients who fight cancer to be treated in hospitals across Egypt, this motivates 
us to think about using the IoT solution that we created to serve those patients by making it 
available for them so they can publish their contact information and the cancer type that they 
fight on a topic ,on our server, which is subscribed by the Egyptian cancer treatment centers 
which will facilitate finding a place for each patient according to their case and age.
